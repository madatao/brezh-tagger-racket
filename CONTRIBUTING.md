## 🧩 How to Contribute

### 1. Fix bugs or improve rules
You may:
- add new morphological rules  
- refine the mutation system (A, M, S, R)  
- improve NP/VG chunking  
- optimise pattern matching  
- rewrite or extend debugging output  

### 2. Add documentation
Every contribution to documentation is valuable:
- rules explained
- mutation examples
- linguistic notes
- code comments

### 3. Add corpora or dictionaries
Parallel corpora (BR–FR, BR–EN, BR–DE…) or lexicons are welcome.

**Important:**  
Make sure you own the rights to any corpus you provide.
